NYC is known to be notoriously expensive, especially with its housing costs. The percentage of people who rent instead of owning is 67.2% as of May 2022. Looking for a place to rent can be a hard task, especially when one is trying to get the best possible place available given their budget. In particular, Manhattan is an especially popular place with very high rent. Therefore, the goal of the project is to help those who are looking for a place to rent in Manhattan. Explanatory models will be built to analyze the relationship between rent prices and factors that impact it using Excel, Python, and Tableau. Predict models such as k-nearest neighbors regressor, multiple linear regressor, and random forest regressor will be used to predict rent prices given the most important factors using Python.
